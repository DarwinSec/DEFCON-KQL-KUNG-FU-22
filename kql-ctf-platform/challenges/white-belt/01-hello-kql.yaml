scenario: |
  Welcome to the KQL Kung Fu dojo, young grasshopper!

  Before you can find needles in haystacks, you must first learn to see the hay.
  Your Azure environment has been logging security events, and somewhere in those
  logs, we've hidden your first flag.

  The flag is hidden in a SecurityEvent record where the Activity field contains
  something special. Can you find it?

objective: "Query the SecurityEvent table and find the record containing the flag."

tables:
  - SecurityEvent

flag:
  value: "FLAG{kql_kung_fu_first_steps}"
  format: exact
  location: "Hidden in Activity field of a specific SecurityEvent record"

hints:
  - cost: 10
    text: "Start by just typing the table name: SecurityEvent"
  - cost: 15
    text: "Use the 'where' operator to filter. Try: where Activity contains \"FLAG\""
  - cost: 25
    text: "The full query is: SecurityEvent | where Activity contains \"FLAG\""

solution:
  query: |
    SecurityEvent
    | where Activity contains "FLAG"
  explanation: |
    This challenge introduces the most basic KQL pattern:
    1. Start with a table name (SecurityEvent)
    2. Use the pipe (|) to chain operators
    3. Use 'where' to filter rows based on conditions
    4. Use 'contains' for case-insensitive substring matching

learning_objectives:
  - "Understanding table-based queries"
  - "Using the pipe operator to chain commands"
  - "Basic filtering with 'where'"
  - "String matching with 'contains'"
