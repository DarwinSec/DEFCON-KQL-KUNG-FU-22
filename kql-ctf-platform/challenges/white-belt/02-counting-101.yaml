scenario: |
  Your security team needs a quick health check on the Azure AD environment.

  The SigninLogs table contains authentication attempts. Your mission is simple:
  count the total number of sign-in events in the dataset.

  But here's the twist - the flag is the count itself! Format your answer as:
  FLAG{kql_kung_fu_COUNT} where COUNT is the exact number you find.

objective: "Count all records in the SigninLogs table and submit the count as the flag."

tables:
  - SigninLogs

flag:
  value: "FLAG{kql_kung_fu_1337}"
  format: exact
  location: "The count of all SigninLogs records"

hints:
  - cost: 10
    text: "KQL has a 'count' operator that returns the number of rows"
  - cost: 15
    text: "Try: SigninLogs | count"
  - cost: 20
    text: "The result will be a single number - format it as FLAG{kql_kung_fu_NUMBER}"

solution:
  query: |
    SigninLogs
    | count
  explanation: |
    The 'count' operator returns the total number of records in the result set.
    This is one of the simplest aggregation operations in KQL.

    Alternative using summarize:
    SigninLogs | summarize count()
